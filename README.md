# DynaDesktop

This project is inspired by and will be a new modern design of project https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop

We do not own the entire code but this project is created for some reasons listed bellow:

1. WinDynamicDesktop is 32bit. I wanted it to support all architectures.
2. It does not have modern UI
3. Using UWP New Native api could help keep application optimized

@t1m0thyj Thank you for the awesome project. I will respect your project. Please feel free to tell me if you don't want me to make this project. I do not want to monotize (For now but if you allow me I would)
